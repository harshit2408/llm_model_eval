      "Paragraph: The company launched its new software with features like data encryption and automatic backups. Pricing information is available, but there's no mention of customer support options.\n",
      "Question: Does it mention pricing?\n",
      "Ground Truth: yes\n",
      "LLM Answer: yes\n",
      "Reasoning: The paragraph explicitly states \"Pricing information is available\", indicating that pricing details are indeed mentioned, even if the specific prices themselves are not provided.\n",
      "Ambiguity Label: clear\n",
      "Ambiguity Reasoning: d classify the question's clarity in relation to the paragraph as **'Clear'**. Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct relevance**: The question directly relates to information presented in the paragraph. The paragraph explicitly mentions \"Pricing information is available\", which is exactly what the question inquires about.\n",
      "2. **Unambiguous terminology**: The term \"pricing\" is used in both the paragraph and the question, eliminating potential confusion that might arise from synonyms or related but distinct concepts.\n",
      "3. **Straightforward answer**: Based on the paragraph, a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" answer can be provided to the question (\"Does it mention pricing?\"). In this case, the answer would be \"Yes, it does mention pricing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors, the question's clarity in relation to the paragraph is straightforward, leaving little to no room for interpretation or confusion.\n",

      "Quality Justification: (Excellent)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Justification:**\n",
      "The reasoning is of high quality because it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurately interprets the text**: The reasoning correctly understands the phrase \"Pricing information is available\" to imply that details about pricing are mentioned, even if the specifics (e.g., numbers) are not provided.\n",
      "2. **Addresses the claim directly**: The reasoning focuses on the explicit mention of pricing information, directly countering any potential assumption that pricing is entirely unmentioned.\n",
      "3. **Avoids over-interpretation**: The reasoning does not read beyond what is explicitly stated, sticking to the text's literal meaning without making unfounded inferences.\n",
      "4. **Demonstrates logical clarity**: The explanation is straightforward, easy to follow, and logically sound, making it a robust justification for its conclusion.\n",

      "Ambiguity Reasoning: d classify the question's clarity in relation to the paragraph as **'Clear'**. Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Directly related topic**: The question is directly related to the content of the paragraph, which discusses the launch of new software and mentions specific aspects of it (features and pricing).\n",
      "2. **Unambiguous terminology**: The term \"customer support\" is used in the question, which has a clear and specific meaning. There's little room for misinterpretation of what is being asked.\n",
      "3. **Paragraph provides a direct answer**: Although the paragraph does not provide detailed information about customer support, it explicitly states that \"there's no mention of customer support options.\" This directly answers the question in a negative light, indicating that customer support is indeed discussed (albeit to state its absence).\n",
      "4. **No contextual assumptions needed**: To answer the question, one doesn't need to make assumptions about the context beyond what's provided in the paragraph. The question can be answered based solely on the information given.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Justification:**\n",
      "The reasoning is rated as Excellent for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Evidence**: The reasoning directly quotes the paragraph, ensuring the interpretation is grounded in explicit text.\n",
      "2. **Clear Inference**: The conclusion logically follows from the quoted text, leaving little room for misinterpretation.\n",
      "3. **Avoids Assumptions**: The reasoning does not make assumptions beyond what is stated; it merely acknowledges the absence of information as explicitly noted in the paragraph.\n",
      "4. **Concise and Transparent**: The explanation is brief, straightforward, and easy to understand, making the thought process behind the conclusion clear.\n",

      "Paragraph: The company launched its new software with features like data encryption and automatic backups. Pricing information is available, but there's no mention of customer support options.\n",
      "Question: Does it talk about data encryption?\n",
      "Ground Truth: yes\n",
      "LLM Answer: yes\n",
      "Reasoning: The paragraph explicitly mentions \"data encryption\" as one of the features of the company's new software, directly answering the question in the affirmative.\n",
      "Ambiguity Label: clear\n",
      "Ambiguity Reasoning: d classify the question's clarity in relation to the paragraph as **'Clear'**. Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Mention**: The paragraph explicitly mentions \"data encryption\" as one of the features of the new software. This direct mention establishes a clear connection between the question and the paragraph.\n",
      "2. **Unambiguous Term**: The term \"data encryption\" is specific and has a widely understood meaning, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation.\n",
      "3. **Simple Yes/No Answer**: The question can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" based on the paragraph's content, which further indicates clarity. In this case, the answer would be \"yes\", it does talk about data encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the question directly references a specific detail from the paragraph, making it easy to understand and answer, hence classified as **'Clear'**.\n",
      "Quality Grade: 1\n",
      "Quality Justification: (Poor)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Justification:** The reasoning provided does not align with the content of the paragraph. The paragraph discusses the launch of new software, its features (data encryption and automatic backups), and the availability of pricing information, but lacks mention of customer support options. However, the question being referenced in the reasoning is not provided, but based on the context, it seems the reasoning is attempting to address a question about customer support or perhaps the existence of a specific feature not related to the one mentioned (data encryption). The reasoning fails to address the actual content of the paragraph in a meaningful way, especially since there's no question provided to evaluate the \"affirmative\" answer to. Effective reasoning should clearly connect the provided information to the question at hand, which is not achieved here.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Mention**: The paragraph directly mentions the display size, stating \"a 6.5-inch display\", which immediately addresses the question.\n",
      "2. **Specificity Match**: The question asks for the display size, and the paragraph provides a specific measurement (6.5 inches), ensuring there's no confusion about what aspect of the display the question refers to.\n",
      "3. **Unambiguous Language**: Both the paragraph and the question use straightforward language, leaving no room for interpretation regarding what is being asked or what information is being provided.\n",
      "4. **Clear Context**: The context of the question (details about the smartphone) is perfectly aligned with the information given in the paragraph, further reducing any potential for ambiguity.\n",

      "3. **Logical conclusion**: The conclusion logically follows from the analysis, correctly summarizing the nature of the information (or lack thereof) provided in the paragraph.\n",
      "4. **Concise expression**: The reasoning is concisely expressed, directly addressing the key points without unnecessary elaboration.\n",
